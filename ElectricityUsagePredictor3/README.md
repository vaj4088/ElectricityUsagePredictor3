Looks at previous meter readings from Smart Meter Texas 
to predict future meter readings.  Note that you MUST
have a Smart Meter for this to work.

1)
Get your latest electricity bill, either a hardcopy bill or online.  A bill
is not strictly required, but much of the information that you will need is
already on the bill.  An online bill will allow you to copy-and-paste
some long numbers.

2)
Download the Oncor meter reading schedule from

http://www.oncor.com/en/Documents/
Commercial%20Metering/2019%20Meter%20Reading%20Schedule%20External.pdf

or equivalent.  You will need this file to know your billing dates.

3)
Use your bill and the Oncor meter reading schedule to figure out
which Bill Cycle you are on.

4)
Use the Bill Cycle number that you just figured out, plus the
Oncor meter reading schedule, to determine the date of your most recent bill
and the date of your next bill.
